## Inline classes not available in iOS

I wanted to use Kotlin's Result type in Swift (not Swift's Result type) but it seems that inline classes cannot be used in Swift.

## Multi shared modules

When using mutliple shared modules. I encountered errors during the iOS build: duplicate symbols. It seems that the Kotlin type definitions being duplicated in the different modules were not merged and produced this error.
